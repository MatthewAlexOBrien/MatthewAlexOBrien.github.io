I'm a pre-doctoral fellow for Andrei Shleifer in Department of Economics at Harvard University. I'm interested in Behavioural Economics, International Development, and how machine learning can be informative for both. I previously held a research position at the London School of Economics and BeWorks. You can find a link to my cv <a href="cv.pdf">here</a>.
